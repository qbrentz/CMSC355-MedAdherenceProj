This Project is a medication adherence tracking application. It allows users to track their medication intake and receive reminders for when to take their medications. Currently, the application is in the early stages of development and is not fully functional. The goal of this project is to create a user-friendly application that helps users manage their medications effectively. As of 4/27/2025, the application functions using a React-based web applpication front-end, leveraging Axios API tools.
